# Data-Structure-Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out principle. Elements are added and removed only from the top, making operations fast and simple. Stacks support push, pop, peek, and isEmpty. They are used in expression evaluation, recursion, and undo features. They help manage program flow and support backtracking in algorithms.
